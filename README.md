# Haskell Book

This repository is a **source** of my solutions to the exercises in [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com).  

For going through this book I'm using [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com), which is a great tool, pretty similar to Xcode Playgrounds.  
Please note that not all exercises are _code_ exercises. Some of them are more theoretical and some are practical ones. You can work this out simply by going to `HaskellBook.hsproj/Theoretical Exercises/Chapter 2/`.
All code exercises are located in specific chapter's directory eg. `Chapter_2` or `Chapter_3`
